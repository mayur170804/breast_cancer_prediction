# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer as **Malignant** or **Benign** using the built-in **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

## Features
- Simple and clean implementation
- Uses Logistic Regression from `scikit-learn`
- 95%+ accuracy on test data
- Makes predictions from custom input

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### How to Run
```python
python breast_cancer_prediction.py
```
### Dataset
The dataset is included in the scikit-learn library, no need to download anything
